Session 01

Introduction


Hi and welcome to "HEAPCODE",

This is going to be a complete session on Linux and I will be 
teaching you how to use linux from scratch to end.

In all our sessions we will be working with "Ubuntu 20.04"
but using this knowledge You can travel and explore any other 
Linux flavour.
Mostly all Linux flavours are same.

Before we begin lets look at some career using Linux

The roles you can make out with Linux knowledge are,
1. System Administrator(as an admin) 
2. Production support engineer (L1/L2/L3)
3. SHELL scripting(as a developer) - the powerful, dirtier & easiest(been for me) form of developing jobs that can do wonders. Linux along with C&C++(Hardware programming) had a lot of scope.


In the next session where do we use Linux in today's world?
