How Linux Works
-------------------

kernel will manage some information
Device info
Multitasking info
File system info

=>this kernel can understand the shell languag and machine language.

Process involved::
user--->command---->shell---->kernel---->processor(CPU).
Rsponse::
processor------>kernel--->shell---->monitor.


Note::shell is one interpreter

in earlier we had shell
SH (bourne shell), KSH,CSH
Now
we have Bash shells
