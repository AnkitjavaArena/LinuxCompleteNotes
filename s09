Basic architecture of OS
------------------------

OS has two main components:
a)Command interpreter (shell) 
b)Kernel 


Command interpreter (shell) 
   -understands the commands by the users and based on that command instructs the kernel.


kernel 
  1. is a core component of OS which is responsible for doing everything in OS including handling and managing  memory management.file mgmt, device mgmt, I/O management , all servies mgmt. ...etc....
  
  2.It is an interface between user interface and hardware.



**Kernel Types: 
a)Monolithic kernel :
   - all OS related components/services/functionalities are stuffed as single module in kernel space(ex: virtual memory mgmt, file system mgmt, device driver, cpu scheduling ,etc....)
   - everything clubbed in kernel space 
   - larger in size but faster execution
   - difficult to debug 
   - to add any new functionality/service the user has to modify the entire OS.
   - if any security issue created, it can corrupt the entire OS...since all servioces are co-related.


b) Micro Kernel 
  -in this kernel, all non-essential components are moved from kernel space to user space.
  (ex:: ipc,device drivers,file server,unix server )
  -only essential components/function such as interProcess communication(IPC), memory management and scheduling are included in kernel space.
  -smaller in size ,slow in execution
  -debugging is easy
  -adding feature/service/component is easy
  -ex:: Windows NT, Mac OS


=>Nowadays we also have hybrid kernel , combination of mono+micro kernel
