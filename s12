** File system hierarchy 
----------------------------

>in windows after booting it allocate/use 
C for system files
bcoz A,B is for floopy earlier.
C- HDD
so automatically one drive will be assigned.

Note::
we install OS in hard drive, by default it creates a disk/drive
partition and stores data in C drive.

so these are drive points in windows
 where you store the data
 in linux these are called mount points.

 in linux we dont have drive-letter concept.windows have.

 Q. then how are we going to store the data
 under
  / -top level directory/folder/root level directory/parent directory

under this we store all the data.
 this is file system Hierarchy.


 /root 
-home directory for root user 
-provides default work env. for  root user

/home
-home directory for normal users
-provides default work env. for normal users

/home/ankit
-home directory form atripathi user.

/boot
-contains all bootable files
-contains bootloaders and etc.
   ex:: bootloaders  Grub2 ->RHEL 7.0,8.0
                     Grub-> RHEL 6.0
    
    Note:: inside these bootloader we will have kernel image. which will help in boot.
